What is engengis?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engengis is like many others a script for android devices.
There is only a huge diffrence between Engengis and other scripts.
Most scripts are totally based on improving something like better RAM or battery.
Engengis is doing something else: it's 100% configureable by the end user.

The main goal is that the end-user desides what's the best for his device.
You must admit all devices are diffrent same as the user off it! So wye should I decide what's best for him?
To achieve the best result Engengis has a lot off features that are configureable.
Not only the features are important but also the knowledge off the user.
That's wye we offer some detailed information about the features we offer.
